intro:
  - excerpt: '<h3>What do I do?</h3>I research a range of topics across ecology and evolution, although this broadly falls into three themes: the evolution of parasite virulence, epidemiological modelling and the development of hybrid frameworks. See below for more information on each of these.'

  - title: "The evolution of parasites"
    excerpt: "We look at the coevolution of two pathogens in a host, one which is mutualistic and one which is parasitic. We ask under which conditions the mutualist invests more resources into protecting its host, and when will the parasite become more or less parasitic. We are also interested in what effects these changes have on the host that harbours these microbes."
  - title: "Epidemiological modelling for COVID-19"
    excerpt: "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, I conducted research on the effect that shielding strategies would have on the overall outcomes of the pandemic, and also investigated the role that NPIs and immunocompromised individuals could have on the emergence of variants."
  - title: "Development of hybrid frameworks"
    excerpt: "In my PhD, we developed algorithms designed to simulate reaction-diffusion systems by employing modelling techniques and combining them in an appropriate way. Such approaches are called hybrid methods. I have also worked on taking these ideas and applying them to epidemiological models, allowing us to accurately model an epidemic and explicit within-host processes."
