intro: 
  - excerpt: 'I am a research associate working with Kayla King and Ben Ashby. My work has been split between modelling various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic and investigating the coevolutionary dynamics of mutualists and parasites in a population of hosts. Previously, I completed my PhD with Kit Yates on "Spatially extended hybrid methods in biology".'
